# Flight Price Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
<br>
<h2>Project Summary :</h2>
<p>End-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering project on flight booking data to prepare a machine learning ready dataset for price prediction.</p>
<p>This project demonstratesstrong skills in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, feature extraction and data visualization, commonly required for Data Analyst, Data Scientist and ML Engineer roles.</p>
<h2>Business Objective :</h2>
<p>Flight ticket prices fluctuate based on multiple parameters such as airline, travel date, duration and number of stops.</p>
<p>The objective is to analyze pricing patterns, engineer meaningful features and create a clean structured dataset suitable for regression based ml model</p>
<h2>Dataset Details :</h2>
